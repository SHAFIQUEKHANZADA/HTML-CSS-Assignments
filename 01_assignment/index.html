    <h1>Modern web development:</h1>
    <p>
      Modern web development refers to the current practices, tools, and
      technologies used to build web applications and websites that are fast,
      interactive, responsive, and user-friendly. It encompasses a wide range of
      areas, from front-end design to back-end architecture, and follows best
      practices for performance, accessibility, and scalability.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Features of Modern Web Development:</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Responsive Design:</b><br />

      Websites and web applications must be adaptable to different screen sizes
      (mobile, tablet, desktop). CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap,
      and media queries are often used to create responsive layouts.
      <b>Component-Based Architecture:</b><br />

      Front-end development has shifted towards component-driven development,
      primarily with frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. Reusable
      components help manage complex UIs and improve maintainability.
      <b>Single Page Applications (SPAs):</b><br />

      SPAs provide a smooth, fast user experience by loading a single HTML page
      and dynamically updating content as the user interacts with the app.
      Frameworks like Next.js, React, and Vue.js are often used.
      <b>JavaScript and TypeScript:</b><br />

      JavaScript is the backbone of modern web development, with the majority of
      websites relying on it for interactivity. TypeScript enhances JavaScript
      by adding static typing, improving code quality, and reducing bugs.
      <b> Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) and Serverless Architecture:</b> <br />

      Cloud-based services such as Firebase, AWS Lambda, and Vercel allow
      developers to create backends without managing servers. These services
      help in scaling applications easily while focusing on core features.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools and Technologies in Modern Web Development:</h2>

    <p>
      Modern web development relies on a combination of powerful tools and
      frameworks to create dynamic, scalable, and responsive applications.
      Popular frontend frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, and Svelte
      allow developers to build interactive user interfaces with ease. On the
      styling side, CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Bulma
      streamline the design process with responsive and customizable UI
      components. <br /><br />
      In terms of programming languages, JavaScript (ES6+) and TypeScript play a
      crucial role in developing both the frontend and backend of applications.
      Backend technologies like Node.js, Express, Python (Django, Flask), and
      Ruby on Rails handle server-side logic, while databases such as MongoDB,
      PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Firebase are used for data storage.
      <br /><br />
      For deployment, hosting services like Vercel, Netlify, AWS, and
      DigitalOcean enable fast and reliable hosting of web applications. Build
      tools like Webpack, Vite, Parcel, and Babel are utilized to bundle and
      optimize code. Version control systems, primarily Git and platforms like
      GitHub and GitLab, allow for efficient collaboration and code management.
      Finally, testing frameworks such as Jest, Mocha, Cypress, and Puppeteer
      ensure code quality and reliability throughout the development lifecycle.
